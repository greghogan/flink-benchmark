A set of configuration and runtime scripts plus logging data collected for 
the following talk given at Flink Forward 2016 in Berlin.

### To Petascale and Beyond: Apache Flink in the Clouds

Abstract: Apache Flink performs with low latency but can also scale to great 
heights. Gelly is Flink’s laboratory for building and tuning scalable graph 
algorithms and analytics. In this talk we’ll discuss writing algorithms 
optimized for the Flink architecture, assembling and configuring a cloud 
compute cluster, and boosting performance through benchmarking and system 
profiling. This talk will cover recent developments in the Gelly library to 
include scalable graph generators and a mixed collection of modular 
algorithms written with native Flink operators. We’ll think like a data 
stream, keep a cool cache, and send the garbage collector on holiday. To 
this we’ll add a lightweight benchmarking harness to stress and validate 
core Flink and to identify and refactor hot code with aplomb.
